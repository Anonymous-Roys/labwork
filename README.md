# **AirTag - Lost & Found and Device Tracking System**

## **Overview**
AirTag is a dual-purpose system designed to help users recover lost items and track missing electronic devices. It leverages a crowd-sourced missing item feed and real-time tracking via user-owned devices.

---

## **Features & Functionality**

### **1. Lost & Found Items**
A community-driven solution for locating lost items through QR-based tagging.

#### **How It Works:**
1. Users generate a unique QR code through our software.
2. The QR code is printed and attached to personal items.
3. If an item is found, the finder scans the QR code and is directed to the item's profile in the missing items feed.
4. The owner receives a notification when their item is scanned.
5. Communication is facilitated through the platform for safe return.

#### **Improvements:**
- Implement a system to verify item ownership before returning.
- Add geotagging when a finder scans the QR code for precise location updates.
- Optional anonymity settings for users to protect personal information.

### **2. Finding Lost Devices**
A robust tracking system that helps users locate lost electronic devices.

#### **How It Works:**
1. A device is linked to the user's account and attached to other owned devices.
2. If a device is lost, other devices owned by the user can be used to locate it.
3. The software should integrate with external tracking solutions like "Google Find My Device" and Apple‚Äôs "Find My" network for seamless tracking.
4. Users can enable "Lost Mode," which:
   - Alerts nearby AirTag users to report a found device.
   - Provides last-known locations when the device was online.
   - Displays a message on the lost device's screen with contact instructions.

#### **Improvements:**
- Implement an encrypted network where other AirTag users can contribute to tracking lost devices anonymously.
- Enable a ‚Äúsmart alert‚Äù system where users get notified when they leave a registered device behind.
- Implement offline tracking via Bluetooth mesh networking.

## **Next Steps**
### **1. Mobile App Development** *(Target Completion: Sunday)*
- Implement both lost item and device tracking features.
- Develop a user-friendly interface for easy navigation.
- Ensure data encryption for privacy and security.
- Conduct testing for QR scanning and device tracking.

### **2. Backend & Cloud Integration**
- Set up a cloud database for item and device registration.
- Develop secure APIs for third-party tracking integrations.
- Implement real-time notifications and messaging.

### **3. Security & Compliance**
- Ensure data privacy and compliance with regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
- Implement authentication features to prevent unauthorized tracking.
- Establish clear policies for lost and found item verification.
